Hi I am Odysseas (pronounced as oh - dh ee s - s EH - aa s). I am currently a PhD student at the [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/eirini-eleni-tsiropoulou/home),  and a member of the PROTON Lab. My research focuses on leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to solve real-world complex problems. I am particularly interested in creating agents that will be able to tackle tough challenges in fields such as Edge AI, Smart Grid Systems, Electric Vehicle Networks and other Multimodal applications.

My prior studies include a MSc, a BSc and a Minor degree. More specifically, I completed my MSc and my BSc in Computer Science at the [Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)](https://aueb.gr/en) under the supervision of Prof. [George C. Polyzos](https://www.aueb.gr/en/faculty_page/polyzos-george) and my Minor in Philosophy at [Deree - The American College of Greece](https://www.acg.edu/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about my research! The time in my area is: <span id="current-time"></span>
